# Kanji Kaizen

## Important note
Kanji Kaizen relies on data provided by the KanjiAlive API. As a result, the application currently supports 1,235 Kanji characters. Please be aware that the availability of media files and other data is contingent upon the APIâ€™s status.

## About the application
Kanji Kaizen is a Kanji learning application that allows users to study and practice Kanjis provided by the KanjiAlive API. The Kanjis from the API are from grades 1 to 6, with a total of 1,235 Kanjis. Kanji Kaizen has no personal progress tracking feature
it was designed to serve as a tool to quickly look up or study a Kanji and challenge one's Kanji knowledge through practice games and allows the user to review the results after each game.

## Features
- **Kanji Lookup**: Quickly find and study a specific Kanji by drawing it, using its radicals/components, or by using its English meaning.
- **Practice Games**: Challenge your Kanji knowledge with interactive games.

## Technologies Used
The application's frontend was built with Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS and the backend was built with Node.js/Express. The applications's drawing search feature relies on the [Kanji Classification Web API](https://github.com/hshnj0216/KanjiClassificationWebAPI).


## Acknowledgements
I extend my gratitude to KanjiAlive for their valuable data, which forms the foundation of this application.
